/*
Create a function that returns the name of the winner in a fight between two fighters.
Each fighter takes turns attacking the other and whoever kills the other first is victorious. 
Death is defined as having health <= 0.

Each fighter will be a Fighter object/instance. 
See the Fighter class below in your chosen language.

Both health and damagePerAttack (damage_per_attack for python) 
will be integers larger than 0. 
You can mutate the Fighter objects.

Your function also receives a third argument, 
a string, with the name of the fighter that attacks first.

Example:
  declare_winner(Fighter("Lew", 10, 2), Fighter("Harry", 5, 4), "Lew") => "Lew"
  Lew attacks Harry; Harry now has 3 health.
  Harry attacks Lew; Lew now has 6 health.
  Lew attacks Harry; Harry now has 1 health.
  Harry attacks Lew; Lew now has 2 health.
  Lew attacks Harry: Harry now has -1 health and is dead. Lew wins.

function Fighter(name, health, damagePerAttack) {
        this.name = name;
        this.health = health;
        this.damagePerAttack = damagePerAttack;
        this.toString = function() { return this.name; }
}
